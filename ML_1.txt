machine learning ml is the scientific study of algorithm and statistical model that computer system use to effectively perform specific task without using explicit instruction relying on pattern and inference instead.it is seen a subset of artificial intelligence.machine learning algorithm build mathematical model of sample data known a training data in order to make prediction or decision without being explicitly programmed to perform the task. machine learning algorithm are used in wide variety of application such a email filtering and computer vision where it is infeasible to develop an algorithm of specific instruction for performing the task.machine learning is closely related to computational statistic which focus on making prediction using computer.the study of mathematical optimization delivers method theory and application domain to the field of machine learning.data mining is field of study within machine learning and focus on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning. in it application across business problem machine learning is also referred to a predictive analytics.overview the name machine learning wa coined in by arthur samuel. tom m.mitchell provided widely quoted more formal definition of the algorithm studied in the machine learning field computer program is said to learn from experience with respect to some class of task and performance measure if it performance at task in a measured by improves with experience e. this definition of the task in which machine learning is concerned offer fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive term.this follows alan turing proposal in his paper computing machinery and intelligence in which the question can machine think is replaced with the question can machine do what we a thinking entity can do . in turing proposal the various characteristic that could be possessed by thinking machine and the various implication in constructing one are exposed.machine learning task are classified into several broad category.in supervised learning the algorithm build mathematical model from set of data that contains both the input and the desired output.for example if the task were determining whether an image contained certain object the training data for supervised learning algorithm would include image with and without that object the input and each image would have label the output designating whether it contained the object.in special case the input may be only partially available or restricted to special feedback. clarification needed semi supervised learning algorithm develop mathematical model from incomplete training data where portion of the sample input doe not have label.classification algorithm and regression algorithm are type of supervised learning.classification algorithm are used when the output are restricted to limited set of value.for classification algorithm that filter email the input would be an incoming email and the output would be the name of the folder in which to file the email.for an algorithm that identifies spam email the output would be the prediction of either spam or not spam represented by the boolean value true and false.regression algorithm are named for their continuous output meaning they may have any value within range.example of continuous value are the temperature length or price of an object.in unsupervised learning the algorithm build mathematical model from set of data which contains only input and no desired output label.unsupervised learning algorithm are used to find structure in the data like grouping or clustering of data point.unsupervised learning can discover pattern in the data and can group the input into category a in feature learning.dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of feature or input in set of data.active learning algorithm access the desired output training label for limited set of input based on budget and optimize the choice of input for which it will acquire training label.when used interactively these can be presented to human user for labeling.reinforcement learning algorithm are given feedback in the form of positive or negative reinforcement in dynamic environment and are used in autonomous vehicle or in learning to play game against human opponent. other specialized algorithm in machine learning include topic modeling where the computer program is given set of natural language document and find other document that cover similar topic.machine learning algorithm can be used to find the unobservable probability density function in density estimation problem.meta learning algorithm learn their own inductive bias based on previous experience.in developmental robotics robot learning algorithm generate their own sequence of learning experience also known a curriculum to cumulatively acquire new skill through self guided exploration and social interaction with human.these robot use guidance mechanism such a active learning maturation motor synergy and imitation. clarification needed arthur samuel an american pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence coined the term machine learning in while at ibm .a scientific endeavour machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence.already in the early day of ai a an academic discipline some researcher were interested in having machine learn from data.they attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic method a well a what were then termed neural network these were mostly perceptrons and other model that were later found to be reinventions of the generalized linear model of statistic. probabilistic reasoning wa also employed especially in automated medical diagnosis. however an increasing emphasis on the logical knowledge based approach caused rift between ai and machine learning.probabilistic system were plagued by theoretical and practical problem of data acquisition and representation. by expert system had come to dominate ai and statistic wa out of favor. work on symbolic knowledge based learning did continue within ai leading to inductive logic programming but the more statistical line of research wa now outside the field of ai proper in pattern recognition and information retrieval. neural network research had been abandoned by ai and computer science around the same time.this line too wa continued outside the ai c field a connectionism by researcher from other discipline including hopfield rumelhart and hinton.their main success came in the mid with the reinvention of backpropagation. machine learning reorganized a separate field started to flourish in the s.the field changed it goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problem of practical nature.it shifted focus away from the symbolic approach it had inherited from ai and toward method and model borrowed from statistic and probability theory. it also benefited from the increasing availability of digitized information and the ability to distribute it via the internet.relation to data mining machine learning and data mining often employ the same method and overlap significantly but while machine learning focus on prediction based on known property learned from the training data data mining focus on the discovery of previously unknown property in the data this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in database .data mining us many machine learning method but with different goal on the other hand machine learning also employ data mining method a unsupervised learning or a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy.much of the confusion between these two research community which do often have separate conference and separate journal ecml pkdd being major exception come from the basic assumption they work with in machine learning performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge while in knowledge discovery and data mining kdd the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge.evaluated with respect to known knowledge an uninformed unsupervised method will easily be outperformed by other supervised method while in typical kdd task supervised method cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data.relation to optimization machine learning also ha intimate tie to optimization many learning problem are formulated a minimization of some loss function on training set of example.loss function express the discrepancy between the prediction of the model being trained and the actual problem instance for example in classification one want to assign label to instance and model are trained to correctly predict the pre assigned label of set of example .the difference between the two field arises from the goal of generalization while optimization algorithm can minimize the loss on training set machine learning is concerned with minimizing the loss on unseen sample. relation to statistic machine learning and statistic are closely related field.according to michael i.jordan the idea of machine learning from methodological principle to theoretical tool have had long pre history in statistic. he also suggested the term data science a placeholder to call the overall field. leo breiman distinguished two statistical modelling paradigm data model and algorithmic model wherein algorithmic model mean more or le the machine learning algorithm like random forest.some statistician have adopted method from machine learning leading to combined field that they call statistical learning. theory main article computational learning theory and statistical learning theory core objective of learner is to generalize from it experience. generalization in this context is the ability of learning machine to perform accurately on new unseen example task after having experienced learning data set.the training example come from some generally unknown probability distribution considered representative of the space of occurrence and the learner ha to build general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate prediction in new case.the computational analysis of machine learning algorithm and their performance is branch of theoretical computer science known a computational learning theory.because training set are finite and the future is uncertain learning theory usually doe not yield guarantee of the performance of algorithm.instead probabilistic bound on the performance are quite common.the bias variance decomposition is one way to quantify generalization error.for the best performance in the context of generalization the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data.if the hypothesis is le complex than the function then the model ha underfit the data.if the complexity of the model is increased in response then the training error decrease.but if the hypothesis is too complex then the model is subject to overfitting and generalization will be poorer. in addition to performance bound learning theorist study the time complexity and feasibility of learning.in computational learning theory computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time.there are two kind of time complexity result.positive result show that certain class of function can be learned in polynomial time.negative result show that certain class cannot be learned in polynomial time.approach type of learning algorithm the type of machine learning algorithm differ in their approach the type of data they input and output and the type of task or problem that they are intended to solve.supervised and semi supervised learning main article supervised learning supervised learning algorithm build mathematical model of set of data that contains both the input and the desired output. the data is known a training data and consists of set of training example.each training example ha one or more input and desired output also known a supervisory signal.in the case of semi supervised learning algorithm some of the training example are missing the desired output.in the mathematical model each training example is represented by an array or vector and the training data by matrix.through iterative optimization of an objective function supervised learning algorithm learn function that can be used to predict the output associated with new input. an optimal function will allow the algorithm to correctly determine the output for input that were not part of the training data.an algorithm that improves the accuracy of it output or prediction over time is said to have learned to perform that task. supervised learning algorithm include classification and regression. classification algorithm are used when the output are restricted to limited set of value and regression algorithm are used when the output may have any numerical value within range.similarity learning is an area of supervised machine learning closely related to regression and classification but the goal is to learn from example using similarity function that measure how similar or related two object are.it ha application in ranking recommendation system visual identity tracking face verification and speaker verification.unsupervised learning main article unsupervised learning see also cluster analysis unsupervised learning algorithm take set of data that contains only input and find structure in the data like grouping or clustering of data point.the algorithm therefore learn from test data that ha not been labeled classified or categorized.instead of responding to feedback unsupervised learning algorithm identify commonality in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonality in each new piece of data.a central application of unsupervised learning is in the field of density estimation in statistic though unsupervised learning encompasses other domain involving summarizing and explaining data feature.cluster analysis is the assignment of set of observation into subset called cluster so that observation within the same cluster are similar according to one or more predesignated criterion while observation drawn from different cluster are dissimilar.different clustering technique make different assumption on the structure of the data often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated for example by internal compactness or the similarity between member of the same cluster and separation the difference between cluster.other method are based on estimated density and graph connectivity.reinforcement learning main article reinforcement learning reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agent ought to take action in an environment so a to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.due to it generality the field is studied in many other discipline such a game theory control theory operation research information theory simulation based optimization multi agent system swarm intelligence statistic and genetic algorithm. in machine learning the environment is typically represented a markov decision process mdp .many reinforcement learning algorithm use dynamic programming technique. reinforcement learning algorithm do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the mdp and are used when exact model are infeasible. reinforcement learning algorithm are used in autonomous vehicle or in learning to play game against human opponent.process and technique various process technique and method can be applied to one or more type of machine learning algorithm to enhance their performance.feature learning main article feature learning several learning algorithm aim at discovering better representation of the input provided during training. classic example include principal component analysis and cluster analysis.feature learning algorithm also called representation learning algorithm often attempt to preserve the information in their input but also transform it in way that make it useful often a pre processing step before performing classification or prediction.this technique allows reconstruction of the input coming from the unknown data generating distribution while not being necessarily faithful to configuration that are implausible under that distribution.this replaces manual feature engineering and allows machine to both learn the feature and use them to perform specific task.feature learning can be either supervised or unsupervised.in supervised feature learning feature are learned using labeled input data.example include artificial neural network multilayer perceptrons and supervised dictionary learning.in unsupervised feature learning feature are learned with unlabeled input data.example include dictionary learning independent component analysis autoencoders matrix factorization and various form of clustering. manifold learning algorithm attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is low dimensional.sparse coding algorithm attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse meaning that the mathematical model ha many zero.multilinear subspace learning algorithm aim to learn low dimensional representation directly from tensor representation for multidimensional data without reshaping them into higher dimensional vector. deep learning algorithm discover multiple level of representation or hierarchy of feature with higher level more abstract feature defined in term of or generating lower level feature.it ha been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns representation that disentangles the underlying factor of variation that explain the observed data. feature learning is motivated by the fact that machine learning task such a classification often require input that is mathematically and computationally convenient to process.however real world data such a image video and sensory data ha not yielded to attempt to algorithmically define specific feature.an alternative is to discover such feature or representation through examination without relying on explicit algorithm.sparse dictionary learning main article sparse dictionary learning sparse dictionary learning is feature learning method where training example is represented a linear combination of basis function and is assumed to be sparse matrix.the method is strongly np hard and difficult to solve approximately. popular heuristic method for sparse dictionary learning is the svd algorithm.sparse dictionary learning ha been applied in several context.in classification the problem is to determine to which class previously unseen training example belongs.for dictionary where each class ha already been built new training example is associated with the class that is best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary.sparse dictionary learning ha also been applied in image de noising.the key idea is that clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary but the noise cannot. anomaly detection main article anomaly detection in data mining anomaly detection also known a outlier detection is the identification of rare item event or observation which raise suspicion by differing significantly from the majority of the data. typically the anomalous item represent an issue such a bank fraud structural defect medical problem or error in text.anomaly are referred to a outlier novelty noise deviation and exception. in particular in the context of abuse and network intrusion detection the interesting object are often not rare object but unexpected burst in activity.this pattern doe not adhere to the common statistical definition of an outlier a rare object and many outlier detection method in particular unsupervised algorithm will fail on such data unless it ha been aggregated appropriately.instead cluster analysis algorithm may be able to detect the micro cluster formed by these pattern. three broad category of anomaly detection technique exist. unsupervised anomaly detection technique detect anomaly in an unlabeled test data set under the assumption that the majority of the instance in the data set are normal by looking for instance that seem to fit least to the remainder of the data set.supervised anomaly detection technique require data set that ha been labeled a normal and abnormal and involves training classifier the key difference to many other statistical classification problem is the inherent unbalanced nature of outlier detection .semi supervised anomaly detection technique construct model representing normal behavior from given normal training data set and then test the likelihood of test instance to be generated by the model.decision tree main article decision tree learning decision tree learning us decision tree a predictive model to go from observation about an item represented in the branch to conclusion about the item target value represented in the leaf .it is one of the predictive modeling approach used in statistic data mining and machine learning.tree model where the target variable can take discrete set of value are called classification tree in these tree structure leaf represent class label and branch represent conjunction of feature that lead to those class label.decision tree where the target variable can take continuous value typically real number are called regression tree.in decision analysis decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decision and decision making.in data mining decision tree describes data but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decision making.association rule main article association rule learning see also inductive logic programming association rule learning is rule based machine learning method for discovering relationship between variable in large database.it is intended to identify strong rule discovered in database using some measure of interestingness . this rule based approach generates new rule a it analyzes more data.the ultimate goal assuming the set of data is large enough is to help machine mimic the human brain feature extraction and abstract association capability for data that ha not been categorized. rule based machine learning is general term for any machine learning method that identifies learns or evolves rule to store manipulate or apply knowledge.the defining characteristic of rule based machine learning algorithm is the identification and utilization of set of relational rule that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system.this is in contrast to other machine learning algorithm that commonly identify singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make prediction. rule based machine learning approach include learning classifier system association rule learning and artificial immune system.based on the concept of strong rule rakesh agrawal tomasz imieli ski and arun swami introduced association rule for discovering regularity between product in large scale transaction data recorded by point of sale po system in supermarket. for example the rule n o s o a o s u g r displaystyle mathrm onion potato rightarrow mathrm burger mathrm onion potato rightarrow mathrm burger found in the sale data of supermarket would indicate that if customer buy onion and potato together they are likely to also buy hamburger meat.such information can be used a the basis for decision about marketing activity such a promotional pricing or product placement.in addition to market basket analysis association rule are employed today in application area including web usage mining intrusion detection continuous production and bioinformatics.in contrast with sequence mining association rule learning typically doe not consider the order of item either within transaction or across transaction.learning classifier system lcs are family of rule based machine learning algorithm that combine discovery component typically genetic algorithm with learning component performing either supervised learning reinforcement learning or unsupervised learning.they seek to identify set of context dependent rule that collectively store and apply knowledge in piecewise manner in order to make prediction. inductive logic programming ilp is an approach to rule learning using logic programming a uniform representation for input example background knowledge and hypothesis.given an encoding of the known background knowledge and set of example represented a logical database of fact an ilp system will derive hypothesized logic program that entail all positive and no negative example.inductive programming is related field that considers any kind of programming language for representing hypothesis and not only logic programming such a functional program.inductive logic programming is particularly useful in bioinformatics and natural language processing.gordon plotkin and ehud shapiro laid the initial theoretical foundation for inductive machine learning in logical setting. shapiro built their first implementation model inference system in prolog program that inductively inferred logic program from positive and negative example. the term inductive here refers to philosophical induction suggesting theory to explain observed fact rather than mathematical induction proving property for all member of well ordered set.model artificial neural network main article artificial neural network see also deep learning an artificial neural network is an interconnected group of node akin to the vast network of neuron in brain.here each circular node represents an artificial neuron and an arrow represents connection from the output of one artificial neuron to the input of another.artificial neural network anns or connectionist system are computing system vaguely inspired by the biological neural network that constitute animal brain. the neural network itself is not an algorithm but rather framework for many different machine learning algorithm to work together and process complex data input. such system learn to perform task by considering example generally without being programmed with any task specific rule.an ann is model based on collection of connected unit or node called artificial neuron which loosely model the neuron in biological brain.each connection like the synapsis in biological brain can transmit information signal from one artificial neuron to another.an artificial neuron that receives signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neuron connected to it.in common ann implementation the signal at connection between artificial neuron is real number and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non linear function of the sum of it input.the connection between artificial neuron are called edge .artificial neuron and edge typically have weight that adjusts a learning proceeds.the weight increase or decrease the strength of the signal at connection.artificial neuron may have threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal cross that threshold.typically artificial neuron are aggregated into layer.different layer may perform different kind of transformation on their input.signal travel from the first layer the input layer to the last layer the output layer possibly after traversing the layer multiple time.the original goal of the ann approach wa to solve problem in the same way that human brain would.however over time attention moved to performing specific task leading to deviation from biology.artificial neural network have been used on variety of task including computer vision speech recognition machine translation social network filtering playing board and video game and medical diagnosis.deep learning consists of multiple hidden layer in an artificial neural network.this approach try to model the way the human brain process light and sound into vision and hearing.some successful application of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition. support vector machine main article support vector machine support vector machine svms also known a support vector network are set of related supervised learning method used for classification and regression.given set of training example each marked a belonging to one of two category an svm training algorithm build model that predicts whether new example fall into one category or the other. an svm training algorithm is non probabilistic binary linear classifier although method such a platt scaling exist to use svm in probabilistic classification setting.in addition to performing linear classification svms can efficiently perform non linear classification using what is called the kernel trick implicitly mapping their input into high dimensional feature space.bayesian network main article bayesian network simple bayesian network.rain influence whether the sprinkler is activated and both rain and the sprinkler influence whether the grass is wet.a bayesian network belief network or directed acyclic graphical model is probabilistic graphical model that represents set of random variable and their conditional independence with directed acyclic graph dag .for example bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationship between disease and symptom.given symptom the network can be used to compute the probability of the presence of various disease.efficient algorithm exist that perform inference and learning.bayesian network that model sequence of variable like speech signal or protein sequence are called dynamic bayesian network.generalization of bayesian network that can represent and solve decision problem under uncertainty are called influence diagram.genetic algorithm main article genetic algorithm genetic algorithm ga is search algorithm and heuristic technique that mimic the process of natural selection using method such a mutation and crossover to generate new genotype in the hope of finding good solution to given problem.in machine learning genetic algorithm were used in the and s. conversely machine learning technique have been used to improve the performance of genetic and evolutionary algorithm. application there are many application for machine learning including agriculture anatomy adaptive website affective computing bioinformatics brain machine interface cheminformatics computer network computer vision credit card fraud detection data quality dna sequence classification economics financial market analysis general game playing handwriting recognition information retrieval insurance internet fraud detection linguistics machine learning control machine perception machine translation marketing medical diagnosis natural language processing natural language understanding online advertising optimization recommender system robot locomotion search engine sentiment analysis sequence mining software engineering speech recognition structural health monitoring syntactic pattern recognition telecommunication theorem proving time series forecasting user behavior analytics in the online movie company netflix held the first netflix prize competition to find program to better predict user preference and improve the accuracy on it existing cinematch movie recommendation algorithm by at least .a joint team made up of researcher from at lab research in collaboration with the team big chaos and pragmatic theory built an ensemble model to win the grand prize in for million. shortly after the prize wa awarded netflix realized that viewer rating were not the best indicator of their viewing pattern everything is recommendation and they changed their recommendation engine accordingly. in the wall street journal wrote about the firm rebellion research and their use of machine learning to predict the financial crisis. in co founder of sun microsystems vinod khosla predicted that of medical doctor job would be lost in the next two decade to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software. in it wa reported that machine learning algorithm had been applied in the field of art history to study fine art painting and that it may have revealed previously unrecognized influence between artist. limitation although machine learning ha been transformative in some field machine learning program often fail to deliver expected result. reason for this are numerous lack of suitable data lack of access to the data data bias privacy problem badly chosen task and algorithm wrong tool and people lack of resource and evaluation problem. in self driving car from uber failed to detect pedestrian who wa killed after collision. attempt to use machine learning in healthcare with the ibm watson system failed to deliver even after year of time and billion of investment. bias main article algorithmic bias machine learning approach in particular can suffer from different data bias.a machine learning system trained on current customer only may not be able to predict the need of new customer group that are not represented in the training data.when trained on man made data machine learning is likely to pick up the same constitutional and unconscious bias already present in society. language model learned from data have been shown to contain human like bias. machine learning system used for criminal risk assessment have been found to be biased against black people. in google photo would often tag black people a gorilla and in this still wa not well resolved but google reportedly wa still using the workaround to remove all gorilla from the training data and thus wa not able to recognize real gorilla at all. similar issue with recognizing non white people have been found in many other system. in microsoft tested chatbot that learned from twitter and it quickly picked up racist and sexist language. because of such challenge the effective use of machine learning may take longer to be adopted in other domain. concern for reducing bias in machine learning and propelling it use for human good is increasingly expressed by artificial intelligence scientist including fei fei li who reminds engineer that there nothing artificial about ai...it inspired by people it created by people and most importantly it impact people.it is powerful tool we are only just beginning to understand and that is profound responsibility. model assessment classification machine learning model can be validated by accuracy estimation technique like the holdout method which split the data in training and test set conventionally training set and test set designation and evaluates the performance of the training model on the test set.in comparison the fold cross validation method randomly partition the data into subset and then experiment are performed each respectively considering subset for evaluation and the remaining subset for training the model.in addition to the holdout and cross validation method bootstrap which sample instance with replacement from the dataset can be used to ass model accuracy. in addition to overall accuracy investigator frequently report sensitivity and specificity meaning true positive rate tpr and true negative rate tnr respectively.similarly investigator sometimes report the false positive rate fpr a well a the false negative rate fnr .however these rate are ratio that fail to reveal their numerator and denominator.the total operating characteristic toc is an effective method to express model diagnostic ability.toc show the numerator and denominator of the previously mentioned rate thus toc provides more information than the commonly used receiver operating characteristic roc and roc associated area under the curve auc . ethic machine learning pose host of ethical question.system which are trained on datasets collected with bias may exhibit these bias upon use algorithmic bias thus digitizing cultural prejudice. for example using job hiring data from firm with racist hiring policy may lead to machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicant against similarity to previous successful applicant. responsible collection of data and documentation of algorithmic rule used by system thus is critical part of machine learning.because language contains bias machine trained on language corpus will necessarily also learn bias. other form of ethical challenge not related to personal bias are more seen in health care.there are concern among health care professional that these system might not be designed in the public interest but a income generating machine.this is especially true in the united state where there is perpetual ethical dilemma of improving health care but also increasing profit.for example the algorithm could be designed to provide patient with unnecessary test or medication in which the algorithm proprietary owner hold stake in.there is huge potential for machine learning in health care to provide professional great tool to diagnose medicate and even plan recovery path for patient but this will not happen until the personal bias mentioned previously and these greed bias are addressed. .
